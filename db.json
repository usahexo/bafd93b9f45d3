is a heart lung machine and how does it work","date":"2022-08-18T12:15:12.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What is a heart lung machine and how does it work?\n\nA heart lung machine (HLM) is a device used to support the function of the heart and lungs during surgery. The HLM pumps blood through the body, providing oxygen to the organs. It also performs other functions such as removing carbon dioxide from the blood.\n\nThe HLM consists of two main parts: the pump and the oxygenator. The pump circulates blood throughout the body while the oxygenator extracts oxygen from air and adds it to the blood.\n\nThe HLM is most commonly used during heart surgery, where it helps to keep the patient's heart and lungs functioning properly. It can also be used during other types of surgery, such as brain surgery or liver transplantation.\n\n#  What are the benefits of using a heart lung machine?\n\nA heart-lung machine, also known as a cardiopulmonary bypass machine, is a device used in open heart surgery to take over the functions of the heart and lungs during the surgery. This machine oxygenates and circulates the patient’s blood.\n\nThere are many benefits of using a heart-lung machine during surgery. One of the most important benefits is that it allows surgeons to work on the heart while it is still beating. This is important because it helps to minimize damage to the heart.\n\nThe heart-lung machine also helps to improve the patient’s survival rate. It minimizes the risk of blood clots and allows for better blood circulation. It also helps to protect the organs from damage during surgery.\n\nOverall, using a heart-lung machine during surgery can provide many benefits for the patient. It allows surgeons to work on the heart while it is still beating, which can help minimize damage to the heart. It also helps to improve the patient’s survival rate and protect organs from damage during surgery.\n\n#  Who can benefit from using a heart lung machine?\n\nA heart lung machine is a device that helps improve the quality of life for people with heart or lung problems. The machine consists of two parts: a console and a bed. The console is where the doctor sits and operates the machine. The bed is where the patient lies.\n\nOne common use for a heart lung machine is to help people who have had surgery on their heart. This type of surgery is called coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). It involves taking a vein from another part of the body, such as the leg, and using it to bypass blockages in the coronary arteries. This allows blood to flow more freely to the heart muscle.\n\nA heart lung machine can also be used to help people who have had surgery on their lungs. This type of surgery is called pulmonary lobectomy. It involves removing one or more lobes of the lung. A heart lung machine may be used during this surgery to keep the blood oxygenated.\n\n#  How often should you use a heart lung machine?\n\nA heart lung machine is a device used to oxygenate the blood and keep the heart beating during surgery. It is either used in conjunction with or instead of a heart-lung bypass machine. The use of a heart-lung machine can be life-saving in some cases, but it can also increase the risk of complications. How often you should use a heart lung machine depends on your individual situation.\n\nIf you need surgery that requires a heart-lung machine, your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of using one with you. There are some situations in which it is clearly necessary, such as when there is damage to the lungs or heart. In other cases, the decision may be less clearcut. For example, if you have coronary artery disease, using a heart-lung machine may increase your risk of stroke.\n\nYour doctor will also consider your age and health history when making a decision about whether to use a heart-lung machine. If you are older or have existing health problems, the risks of using a machine may outweigh the benefits.\n\n#  Are there any risks associated with using a heart lung machine?\n\nThere are a few risks associated with the use of a heart lung machine. One of the biggest risks is that the machine can cause blood clots to form. This can lead to a number of health problems, including stroke, heart attack, and death.\n\nAnother risk associated with heart lung machines is damage to the lungs. The machine can cause the lungs to become inflamed and scarred. This can make it difficult for the lungs to function properly and can lead to long-term health problems.\n\nFinally, there is a small risk that the machine will malfunction and cause serious injury or death. This is why it is important to only use a heart lung machine if it is prescribed by a doctor and supervised by a medical professional.","source":"_posts/What-is-a-heart-lung-machine-and-how-does-it-work.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is a heart lung machine and how does it work\ndate: 2022-08-18 20:15:12\ncategories:\n- Heart Lung Machine\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is a heart lung machine and how does it work?\n\nA heart lung machine (HLM) is a device used to support the function of the heart and lungs during surgery.
